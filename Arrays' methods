#tuples : tuples are similar to lists as they are used to store a number of sequences ,but they cannot modified or changed ,instead they
#just can be created.We usually use lists , but in some cases we don't want our sequence become changed so in this case we use tuples
# so we don't have mehods like append or insert or remove in tuples , but we have some magical methods like __add__
